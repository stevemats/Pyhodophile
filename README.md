## Definations:
**KNN**(K-Nearest Neighbors) as seen in demo above under classifiers, is a simple algorithm used in Machine Learning for regression and classification problem. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure

**Random Forest** also seen in the demo, is a machine learning technique thatâ€™s used to solve regression and classification problems. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.

Finally we have **SVM**(Support Vector machine), which is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

## Usage
```
streamlit run main.py
```
